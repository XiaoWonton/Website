            <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <h2>Why do you want to make a career change?</h2>
                <p>I feel like I have explored the various options in the SLP field and am looking for change. I want to continue challenging myself and learning new things.</p>
            <h2>Why should you be considered for software engineering roles?</h2>
                <p>I have completed college level CS classes (e.g., introduction to java, introduction to linux) and have a passion for continuing to develop my skills to become software engineer. My career as an SLP has allowed to develop transferable skills including management experience, time management, and effective communication.</p>
            <h2>What projects have you completed or are working on?</h2>
                <p>I have completed up to week 9 of Harvard's online CS50 course and am working on a text based RPG game in java. I am also planning on making a database of food consistencies for SLP's and their patients.</p>
            <h2>Do you have any pets?</h2>
                <p>Yes I do. Thank you for asking. Here's a picture of her!</p>
